Mark whatever is done 
Features to add:
- update the failure mechanisms to ensure that we check if the db was updated but not the faiss idx and vice versa [ Consistency ], \
    eg: mongo write succeeds, FAISS fails
- Easy to see benchmarks, logs, comparisons, tables, graphs per VS (Vector Search) type
- Lucene 
- Async
- proper imports and error logging etc
- Page that allows users to compare between base MongoDB VS, FAISS VS and Lucene VS
- Allow user to switch between base, FAISS and Lucene easily while keeping data consistent
- Expose internal state and health of the vector store, Store index metadata in Mongo
- Since I have save and load faiss index [FAISS version] , we have to save the index on closing, and load it on startup 
    check how to keep it safe and stored so even if the app crashes the index remains safe and updated (lazy loading or whatever)
    gotta keep track of how large the index becomes cause if its too massive, will be tough on loading (may even crash everyhting)
- ML infra (keep updating the index retraining etc thresholds based on current data) or whatever we can do in ML for better performance and scalabilitry
- hybrid search (dense, sparse)
- Security things if possible : Input val and all that
